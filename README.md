### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Denis.
I am a certified ISTQB FL QA Engineer.
My major is testing algorithms and Ui using Python and related libraries.

I have almost 3 years of experience as QA Engineer. 
I worked with logistic chains and interactive boards.

My tech stack:
 - Python
 - Pytest
 - Selenium/Playwright
 - Docker
 - Locust/Gatling
 - CI/CD
 - SQL
 - Postman/Fiddler
 - GIT
 - Pandas


Here you can check my own project, where I implement a Page Object Model pattern for UI and API tests for open-source project.
I tried to make my project scalable and easily maintainable. And in my opinion, the goal is achieved.
